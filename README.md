#Acknowledgments

I would like to thank everyone who somehow helped me with the game, Professor, T.A.'s and classmates!

It was very busy, but extremely rewarding to work on this project!

I can not pass up the opportunity to especially thank Professor Henrique Mendes, Ismael Cardoso and Manu, if it were not for them I would not be here and would not have the privilege of building this game.

Thank you!
